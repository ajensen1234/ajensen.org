# Andrew Jensen

I'm a software engineer at Vent Creativity, where I apply my technical expertise to develop innovative solutions.

## Professional Background

Prior to joining Vent, I was pursuing my PhD at the University of Florida as the McJunkin Fellow at the Gary J. Miller PhD Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory. My academic research focused on automating the process of extracting 6 degree-of-freedom joint kinematics from 2D fluoroscopic images.

## Current Work

At Vent Creativity, I leverage my background in engineering and problem-solving to create efficient and effective software solutions. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and transforming them into practical applications.
