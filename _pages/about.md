Hi everyone! My name is Andrew Jensen, and I'm a 3rd-year PhD student at the University of Florida. I'm the McJunkin Fellow at the Gary J. Miller PhD Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory. My main research focus is automating the process of extracting 6 degree-of-freedom joint kinematics from 2D fluoroscopic images so that surgeons and researchers can better use this information in their work.
